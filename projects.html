        <p>
            These are some of my Projects from my Github Repositories. I only upload my best works on Github, so all
            these projects are good. I will upload all of my projects related to programming here. I hope it will help
            you a lot if you also are learning any of these languages that I mentioned at the languages section in About
            Me Page.

            <h2>1. Chemical Formula Maker - Python</h2>
            <img class="projects_img" src="images/cfm.jpg">
            <p>
                This is the most advanced Python Program I've ever made. If you want to see my level in basic Python,
                just check this project. It has a lot of Logic behind each functions and if you are also learning
                Python, this project can be very helpful to you. This program basically tells you the product formed
                when a Metal and Non-Metal elements react with each other via their valency. You can even add more
                Metals and Non-Metals with their valency and then make the reaction between them.

            <img class="projects_img" src="images/papc.jpg">
            <p>
                This is a simple program which will help you find your percentage in an exam and you can even calculate
                your Percentile which will determine your Rank among all the exam candidates. This program can also be
                helpful to some beginner programmers or if you really want to use it in real life you can do it so.

            <p>
                This is also one my Github Repository's Projects. This website represents a Landing Page of a Coding
                Website. I think I will complete is further because I can now make better websites than this but for me
                it is still one of my Masterpieces in Programming

            <p>
                This website is my Best Website I've ever created in past 3 years of Web Development. Although it is not
                completed yet but I promise it will not disappoint anyone who will visit this site. I'm still working on
                it to make it better. I will make this website with my full potential and the best design I can possibly
                make. This website is my Portfolio as its name suggests, and it includes everything about myself and me
                as a Programmer.

            <p>
                This is a Login Page and I've also made a Youtube video in which I made this in 47 minutes. Although its
                not that good but it can be helpful to you if you check out my approach in the HTML/CSS code. It will
                defintely help you if you are a beginner or medium coder in CSS.
